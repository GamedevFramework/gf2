`OutputStream` is the base class for all output streams.

xref:core_streams.adoc[< Back to `core` Streams]

== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf2/Stream.h>
class OutputStream;
----

An output stream can be used to save resources to various data sinks.

The classes that inherits `OutputStream` are:

- xref:BufferOutputStream.adoc[`BufferOutputStream`]
- xref:CompressedOutputStream.adoc[`CompressedOutputStream`]
- xref:FileOutputStream.adoc[`FileOutputStream`]
- xref:MemoryOutputStream.adoc[`MemoryOutputStream`]

See also: xref:InputStream.adoc[`InputStream`]

== Member Functions

[#_constructors]
=== `OutputStream` contructors

[source]
----
OutputStream() = default; <1>
OutputStream(const OutputStream&) = delete; <2>
OutputStream(OutputStream&&) noexcept = default; <3>
----

<1> Default constructor.
<2> Deleted copy constructor.
<3> Defaulted move constructor.

=== `OutputStream` destructor

[source]
----
virtual ~OutputStream();
----

Destructor is virtual so that you can use pointers to `OutputStream` safely.

=== `operator=`

[source]
----
OutputStream& operator=(const OutputStream&) = delete; <1>
OutputStream& operator=(OutputStream&&) noexcept = default; <2>
----

<1> Deleted copy assignment.
<2> Defaulted move assignment.

=== `write`

[source]
----
virtual std::size_t write(Span<const uint8_t> buffer) = 0; <1>
std::size_t write(uint8_t byte); <2>
----

<1> Write data to the stream from a buffer
<2> Write a single byte to the stream

Return the number of bytes actually written.

=== `written_bytes`

[source]
----
virtual std::size_t written_bytes() const = 0;
----

Return the number of bytes actually written so far.
