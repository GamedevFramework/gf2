This article describes how Vulkan is used in gf2.

xref:graphics_low_level.adoc[< Back to `graphics` Low-Level]

== Vulkan

link:https://www.vulkan.org/[Vulkan] is a low-level cross-platform graphics API. gf2 uses *Vulkan 1.3* that was released on 25th January 2022. More precisely, gf2 takes advantage of link:https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering.html[`VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`], an extension that simplifies the rendering code and is recommanded by the main GPU providers.

=== volk

link:https://github.com/zeux/volk[volk] is "a meta-loader for Vulkan".

gf2 uses volk to load the Vulkan entrypoints dynamically. This is hidden from the gf2 interface.

=== vk-bootstrap

link:https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap/[`vk-bootstrap`] is "a utility library that jump starts initialization of Vulkan".

gf2 uses `vk-bootstrap` to initialize some of the basic structures on Vulkan: `VkInstance`, `VkPhysicalDevice`, `VkDevice` and `VkSwapchain`. This is hidden from the gf2 interface.

=== Vulkan Memory Allocator

link:https://gpuopen.com/vulkan-memory-allocator/[Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA)] "provides a simple and easy to integrate API to help you allocate memory for Vulkan buffer and image storage".

gf2 uses VMA to allocate memory for `VkBuffer` and `VkImage` instances. This library is a public dependency of gf2.
