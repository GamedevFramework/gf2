This article describes how Vulkan is used in gf2.

xref:graphics_low_level.adoc[< Back to `graphics` Low-Level]

== Vulkan

link:https://www.vulkan.org/[Vulkan] is a low-level cross-platform graphics API. gf2 uses *Vulkan 1.3* that was released on 25th January 2022. More precisely, gf2 takes advantage of link:https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering.html[`VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`] (which has been promoted to Vulkan 1.3), an extension that simplifies the rendering code and is recommanded by the main GPU providers. Older GPU, especially on Windows, may not support Vulkan 1.3.

=== volk

link:https://github.com/zeux/volk[volk] is "a meta-loader for Vulkan".

gf2 uses volk to load the Vulkan entrypoints dynamically. This library is a public dependency of gf2.

=== vk-bootstrap

link:https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap/[`vk-bootstrap`] is "a utility library that jump starts initialization of Vulkan".

gf2 uses `vk-bootstrap` to initialize some of the basic structures on Vulkan: `VkInstance`, `VkPhysicalDevice`, `VkDevice` and `VkSwapchain`. This is hidden from the gf2 interface.

=== Vulkan Memory Allocator

link:https://gpuopen.com/vulkan-memory-allocator/[Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA)] "provides a simple and easy to integrate API to help you allocate memory for Vulkan buffer and image storage".

gf2 uses VMA to allocate memory for `VkBuffer` and `VkImage` instances. This library is a public dependency of gf2.

== Architecture

=== `gf::Renderer`

xref:Renderer.adoc[`gf::Renderer`] is the control tower of the low-level graphics stack. It is responsible for initializing everything, handling synchronization, and creating all the other classes.
