== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf/network/TcpListener.h>
class TcpListener : public Socket;
----

*Inherits*: xref:Socket.adoc[`Socket`]

A TCP listener is a network socket that can handle incoming connections from remote hosts. It can be used to create a TCP server. The listener is associated to a service. The service can be a port number.

.Example for `gf::TcpListener`: service identified by a port number

For well-known services, it can also be a name.

A TCP listener is generally created oustide the main loop. Then, for a synchronous server that handles one connection at the time, the listener accept a connection and handle the client.

== Member functions

=== `TcpListener` constructors

[source]
----
TcpListener(); <1>
TcpListener(const std::string& service, SocketFamily family = SocketFamily::Unspec); <2>
----

<1> Create an invalid listener.
<2> Create a valid listener with an associated service.

=== `accept`

[source]
----
TcpSocket accept();
----

Accept a new connection from a remote client.

This member function blocks until a new connection arrives (unless the socket was made non-blocking). Then a socket is created for the remote client and returned. The returned socket can be used to communicate with the client.

=== `accept_with_address`

[source]
----
std::tuple<TcpSocket, SocketAddress> accept_with_address();
----

Accept a new connection from a remote client.

This member function blocks until a new connection arrives (unless the socket was made non-blocking). Then a socket is created for the remote client and returned. The returned socket can be used to communicate with the client.

In addition, the caller can obtain the socket address of the remote client when it is accepted.
