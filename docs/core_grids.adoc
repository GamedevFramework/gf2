The grids component provides the classes for handling maps organized in grids.

A grid is a set of cells with a specific organization. As a grid is a two-dimensional object, the cells of a grid can be identified with two coordinates. Some kind of grids have several variants according to the layout of the grid. The library supports the following types of grid:

- Orthogonal grids (rectangle cells organised in a rectangle)
- Isometric grids (rhombus cells organised in a rhombus)
- Staggered grids (rhombus cells organised in a rectangle)
- Hexagonal grids (hexagon cells organised in a rectangle)
