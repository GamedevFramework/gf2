A transform object contains data about an entity's location, rotation and scale.

xref:core_coordinates.adoc[< Back to `core` Coordinates]

== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf2/core/Transform.h>
struct Transform;
----

Each entity has a *reference point* that defines the origin of the different basic transformations. This point is defined by `origin`, the relative position of the reference point in the bouding box of the entity. If the reference point is at the center of the entity, the origin is stem:[(0.5, 0.5)].

Then, the entity will be scaled with a factor of `scale`, rotated with an angle of `rotation` and translated with a vector of `location`.

At the end, `Transform` contains all the information to compute an link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix#Affine_transformations[affine transformation matrix].
