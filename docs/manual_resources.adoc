Loading (and unloading) resources is an essential task in a game.

In this section, we try to understand how the resource system works and we learn how to define a bundle of ressources that can easily be loaded at any time.

== Resources

The library provides a component that can handle many types of resources in a very generic way. The heart of this component is xref:ResourceManager.adoc[`gf::ResourceManager`].

=== Resource Manager

The resource manager knows all the resource that have been loaded and how many times they have been loaded through a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting[reference couting] mechanism. Each time you call `load`, you increase the number of references, and each time you call `unload`, you decrease the number of references until it reaches zero and the resource is deleted. Once loaded, you can get a pointer to the resource as many times as you want.

In order to load a resource, you must have defined and registered a resource registry for the type of the resource. If you want maximum flexibility, you can define your own registries and their associated loaders.

=== Resource System

xref:ResourceSystem.adoc[`gf::ResourceSystem`] is a resource manager that contains the registries for all known resources in the library (see <<list_of_resources>>). It uses a file loader with a root asset directory passed at the construction of the system.

=== User-Defined Loader

Sometimes you may want to define your own loader. For example, imagine you want to use link:https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/#audio-module[SFML2 Audio module] (instead of xref:reference.adoc#audio[gf2 `audio` library]). The resource classes in SFML2 do not take a link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/path[`std::filesystem::path`] in their constructor, they are loaded through a `loadFromFile` method.

You can define your own loader for all SFML resources. This loader is very basic, it does not handle a root asset directory, but it can easily be tweaked for your own purpose.

Finally, you can create a registry for the `sf::SoundBuffer` resource and add it to a resource system. From now on, you will be able to use `sf::SoundBuffer` like any other resources in the library.

=== List of Resources

The following table provides a list of resources in the gf2 library that can be loaded with a resource manager, either through a filename, or through an xref:InputStream.adoc[`InputStream`].
