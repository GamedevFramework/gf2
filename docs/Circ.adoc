A `Circ<T>` represents a circle.

== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf2/Circ.h>
template<typename T>
struct Circ;
----

A circle is defined by its center and its radius. It is a very simple class defined for convenience, so its data members (`center` and `radius`) are public and can be accessed directly.

`Circ<T>` is a template and may be used with any numeric type, but for simplicity, some common typedef are defined:

- `CircF` with `float` as `T`
- `CircD` with `double` as `T`
- `CircI` with `int` as `T`
- `CircU` with `unsigned` as `T`

== Static Member Functions

=== `from_center_radius`

[source]
----
constexpr Circ from_center_radius(Vec2<T> center, T radius) noexcept;
----

Create a circle from a center and a radius.

=== `from_radius`

[source]
----
constexpr Circ from_radius(T radius) noexcept;
----

Create a circle from a radius, the center is at stem:[(0,0)].

== Member Functions

=== `contains`

[source]
----
constexpr bool contains(Vec2<T> point) const noexcept;
----

Check if a point is inside the circle.

=== `empty`

[source]
----
constexpr bool empty() const noexcept;
----

Check if the circle is empty, i.e. if the radius of the circle is zero.

=== `intersects`

[source]
----
constexpr bool intersects(Circ other) const noexcept;
----

Check if two circles intersect.

== Operators

=== `operator==`

[source]
----
template<typename T>
constexpr bool operator==(Circ<T> lhs, Circ<T> rhs);
----

Test the equality of two circles.

=== `operator!=`

[source]
----
template<typename T>
constexpr bool operator!=(Circ<T> lhs, Circ<T> rhs);
----

Test the inequality of two circles.
