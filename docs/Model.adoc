== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf2/core/Model.h>
class Model;

A model is simpler than a xref:Entity.adoc[`Entity`] because it has no priority. It can typically be used to encapsulate a physics engine.

Models can be grouped in a xref:ModelContainer.adoc[`ModelContainer`].

== Member Functions

=== `update`

[source]
----
virtual void update(Time time);
----

Update the model's state.

Models are updated each frame. The time between two frames is given as a parameter to help in the update.
