== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf2/core/ModelContainer.h>
class ModelContainer;
----

`ModelContainer` represents a collection of models that are updated automatically.

The model container is *not* responsible for the memory of the models. The models must be allocated by the user and not deleted while they are handled by the model container.

Generally, you only need one model container in your game. You create it at the beginning of the game and put all your models in it. Then you can call <<update>> in your game loop.
