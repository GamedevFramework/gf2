`Packet` can ease the serialization of network messages.

== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf/Packet.h>
class Packet;
----

A `Packet` is a sequence of bytes that comes from the serialization of a structure. The structure must have a static member `type` of type xref:Id.adoc[`Id`] that identifies the structure. To transform a structure in a sequence of bytes, you must use <<_set>>, and then use this sequence of bytes in a network communication (for example). To transform a sequence of bytes that may come from a network communication into a structure, you must use <<_as>>.

== Member functions


=== `as`

[source]
----
template<typename T>
T as()

Span<uint8_t> as_span();
Span<const uint8_t> as_span() const;
----

Get the underlying bytes as a span.

=== `ensure_size`

[source]
----
void ensure_size(std::size_t size);
----

Ensure that the sequence of bytes is large enough.

=== `set`

[source]
----
template<typename T>
void set(const T& data)
