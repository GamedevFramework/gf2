A `Range2D<T>` represents a range accross a 2D area.

xref:core_container.adoc[< Back to `core` Container]

== Description

The 2D area is defined by a xref:Range.adoc[`Range<T>`] accross the first dimension, called `dx`, and a xref:Range.adoc[`Range<T>`] accross the second dimension, called `dy`. The associated iterator starts at the top-left (the minimum of each range) of the area and finish at the bottom-right (the maximum of each range), iterating over the first dimension first and then over the second dimension.

== Types

=== `Range2D<T>::Iterator`

A link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ForwardIterator[forward iterator] that is used for iterating over the range.

== Member functions

=== `begin`

[source]
----
constexpr Iterator begin() const noexcept;
----

Get an iterator to the start of the range.

=== `end`

[source]
----
constexpr Iterator end() const noexcept;
