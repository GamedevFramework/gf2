== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf/UdpSocket.h>
class UdpSocket : public Socket;
----

*Inherits*: xref:Socket.adoc[`Socket`]

UDP provides an unreliable communication between two hosts. UDP is connectionless i.e. no connection is established, the receiver must be set for each communication.

== Member functions

=== `UdpSocket` constructor

[source]
----
UdpSocket() = default; <1>
UdpSocket(AnyType any, SocketFamily family = SocketFamily::Unspec); <2>
UdpSocket(const std::string& service, SocketFamily family = SocketFamily::Unspec); <3>
----

<1> Create an invalid socket.
<2> Create a socket that is not bound to a specific port. The port is chosen by the system. It may be used by a client that do not need a specific port.
<3> Create a socket that is bound to a specific port. It must be used in case a server wants to be joined with UDP on a specific port.

=== `send_bytes_to`

[source]
----
bool send_bytes_to(Span<const uint8_t> buffer, const SocketAddress& address);
----

Send a whole buffer to the socket. This function ensures the buffer is sent in a single packet. Return a boolean indicating if the bytes have been sent.

=== `send_raw_bytes_to`

[source]
----
SocketDataResult send_raw_bytes_to(Span<const uint8_t> buffer, const SocketAddress& address);
----

Send some bytes over the socket to `address`.

=== `recv_bytes_from`

[source]
----
std::tuple<bool, SocketAddress> recv_bytes_from(Span<uint8_t> buffer);
----

Send a whole buffer to the socket. This function ensures the buffer is received in a single packet. Return a boolean indicating if the bytes have been received and the address of the sending host.

=== `recv_raw_bytes_from`

[source]
----
std::tuple<SocketDataResult, SocketAddress> recv_raw_bytes_from(Span<uint8_t> buffer);
----

Receive some bytes from the socket. Return a result and the address of the sending host.

=== `remote_address`

[source]
----
SocketAddress remote_address(const std::string& hostname, const std::string& service);
----

Get a remote address for this socket. This function provides a suitable socket address that can be used with the sending functions.
