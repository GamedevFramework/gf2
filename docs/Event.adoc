`Event` describes system events i.e. events that come from a window, a keyboard, a mouse or a gamepad.

== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf2/graphics/Event.h>
class Event;
----

Events are generally polled from the system in a loop and handled immediately.

.Example for `gf::Event` loop
[source,indent=0]
----
include::snippets/graphics_event.cc[tag=loop]
----

Based on the type of the event, specific event data can be retrieved using <<get>> or, better, <<from>>.

== Static Member Functions

=== `poll`

[source]
----
std::optional<Event> poll();
----

Pop the event on top of the event queue, if any, and return it.

This function is not blocking: if there's no pending event then it will return `std::nullopt`. Note that more than one event may be present in the event queue, thus you should always call this function in a loop to make sure that you process every pending event.

=== `wait`

[source]
----
Event wait();
----

Wait for an event and return it.

This function is blocking: if there's no pending event then it will wait until an event is received. This function is typically used when you have a thread that is dedicated to events handling: you want to make this thread sleep as long as no new event is received.

== Member functions

=== `Event` constructors

[source]
----
Event() = default; <1>
template<typename T>
constexpr Event(uint64_t timestamp, T&& data); <2>
----

<1> Default constructor. The type if the event is `gf::EventType::None`.
<2> Constructor with a timestamp and specific event data.

=== `is`

[source]
----
template<typename T>
constexpr bool is() const;
----

Check if the specific data type is `T`.

See also: <<get>>

=== `from`

[source]
----
template<EventType E>
constexpr auto& from();
template<EventType E>
constexpr const auto& from() const;
----

Get the specific event data associated with the event `E`

See also: <<get>>

=== `get`

[source]
----
template<typename T>
constexpr T& as();
template<typename T>
constexpr const T& as() const;
----

Get the specific event data of type `T`. Generally, if the event type is `gf::EventType::Foo`, then the associated specific data type is `FooEvent`.

See also: <<is>>, <<from>>

=== `timestamp`

[source]
----
constexpr uint64_t timestamp() const;
----

Get the timestamp of the event.

=== `type`

[source]
----
constexpr EventType type() const;
----

Get the type of the event.
