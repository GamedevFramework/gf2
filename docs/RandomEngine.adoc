`RandomEngine` is a link:https://prng.di.unimi.it/[modern random engine].

xref:core_utilities.adoc[< Back to `core` Utilities]

== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf2/Random.h>
class RandomEngine;
----

The random engine uses link:https://prng.di.unimi.it/xoshiro256plusplus.c[xoshiro256++] which is fast and shows good statistical behavior.

`RandomEngine` satisfies the requirements of link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/UniformRandomBitGenerator[UniformRandomBitGenerator] and can be used like any other random engines from the standard library. In particular, it may be used with any link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random[random number distributions].
