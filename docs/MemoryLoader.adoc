`MemoryLoader` is a resource loader for resources in memory.

xref:core_resources.adoc[< Back to `core` Resources]

== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf2/ResourceLoaders.h>
class MemoryLoader;
----

`MemoryLoader` keeps a dictionary of buffers (often files that have been embedded in the source code) that represent resources in memory. Each buffer is identified by a path.

`MemoryLoader` provides a generic loader, so you should use xref:core_resources.adoc#_loader_for[`loader_for`] in order to use it with xref:ResourceRegistry.adoc[`ResourceRegistry`].

== Member Functions

=== `operator()`

[source]
----
template<typename T>
std::unique_ptr<T> operator()(const std::filesystem::path& path, const ResourceContext<T>& context = {});
----

Generic loader for a resource in memory. The resource type `T` should provide a constructor with a `InputStream&` argument. Moreover if the resource has a non-empty context, the constructor must have a second argument of type `const ResourceContext<T>&`.

See also: xref:InputStream.adoc[`InputStream`]

=== `add_buffer`

[source]
----
void add_buffer(std::filesystem::path path, Span<uint8_t> buffer);
----

Add a buffer associated to its path in the memory loader.

=== `search`

[source]
----
Span<uint8_t> search(const std::filesystem::path& relative_path);
----

Search a buffer in the dictionary. Return an empty span if no buffer has been found.
