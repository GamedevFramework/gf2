== Member functions

=== `TcpSocket` constructors

[source]
----
TcpSocket() = default; <1>
TcpSocket(const std::string& hostname, const std::string& service, SocketFamily family = SocketFamily::Unspec); <2>
----

<1> Create an invalid socket.
<2> Create a socket for `hostname` and `service`, using `family`.

=== `TcpSocket` destructor

[source]
----
~TcpSocket();
----

Shutdown the connection.

=== `send_bytes`

[source]
----
SocketResult send_bytes(Span<const uint8_t> buffer);
----

Send a whole buffer to the socket. This function ensures the whole buffer is sent unless an error occurs.

=== `send_packet`

[source]
----
SocketResult send_packet(const Packet& packet);
----

Send a packet to the socket.

=== `send_raw_bytes`

[source]
----
SocketResult send_raw_bytes(Span<const uint8_t> buffer);
----

Send some bytes over to the socket.

See also: <<recv_raw_bytes>>

=== `recv_bytes`

[source]
----
SocketResult recv_bytes(Span<uint8_t> buffer);
----

Receive a whole buffer from the socket. This function ensures the whole buffer is received unless an error occurs.
