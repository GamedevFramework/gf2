As its name indicates, Gamedev Framework 2 is a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework[framework]. It means that you have to think your game architecture to fit the framework. If you happen to fight the framework to make your game, it probably means that the framework is not for you and you should revise your choice.

This section will teach you how to organize your game globally, from top to bottom. First, you have to split your game in different acts, each act having some scenes. Then you have to make your game model, it's the core of your game, where your game implements the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics[game mechanics]. Finally, you have to bring your game on the screen with resources (graphics, sounds, maps) and entities in charge of using the resources.

== Acts and Scenes

In this section, we see how to split a game into several components called acts. Each act can then be split into scenes. Figure <<acts_scenes>> gives an overview of a game with two acts: _Kickoff_ and _World_.

=== Acts

A *game* is represented by a class that derives from a scene manager. Generally, xref:SceneSystem.adoc[`gf::SceneSystem`] is the scene manager you want. It provides a random engine, a resource manager, a font manager and an audio manager. A game is composed of one or several acts. For simple games, a single act is enough. For more complex games, with an initial menu with several features, and then one or several large levels, you may need several acts.

In order to define the game represented in the previous figure, you can declare the `Game` class. In this case, the _World_ act (`WorldAct`) is associated with a model (`WorldModel`), but not the _Kickoff_ act (`KickoffAct`) because the _Kickoff_ act does not need data or state.

An *act* is a set of one or more consistent scenes. Each act is associated with its own resources (see <<resources-and-entities>>) and it can be associated with a model (see <<model-data-and-state>>). An act can be loaded asynchronously if its loading time needs a beautiful loading scene, but the first act must be loaded as fast as possible.

An act generally needs the game class (`Game`) and the relevant resources to initialize all the scenes. The _World_ act (`WorldAct`) has two scenes: the _Map_ scene (`MapScene`) and the _Options_ scene (`OptionsScene`) that are initialized in the act's contructor.

=== Scenes

A *scene* is a game loop that is split into different steps. In the scene manager, scenes are organized in a stack at runtime. You can push a scene, pop a scene or completely replace all the scenes (generally when you go through the next act). When multiple scenes are in the stack, the different steps are called for every scenes, from the bottom of the stack to the top of the stack. The scope of a scene can vary according to the game and inside a game. Generally, when you need a new set of actions (keyboard, mouse, etc) and/or a new set of entities to render elements of the game, you need a new scene.

A scene class derives from xref:BasicScene.adoc[`gf::BasicScene`] that provides only basic features. For a general purpose scene, you may want to derive from xref:Scene.adoc[`gf::Scene`]. This scene is built around two set of entities: the world entities that are meant to be in the world of the game; the hud entities that are meant to display link:HUD[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUD_(video_games)] elements.

== Model, Data and State

== Resources and Entities

== Conclusion

Of course, when you build your game, you go through every parts of the architecture. For example, if you want to add a timer, you will add a class `TimerState` in the state of your game, and update it when the model updates by adding the frame time. Then you will add an entity `TimerRenderer` to render the timer, you will probably need a font and a text resource. Finally, you will add your entity in a (potentially new) scene as an HUD entity. And so on.

The next sections will revisit each part of the architecture more deeply.
