`InputStream` is the base class for all input streams.

xref:core_streams.adoc[< Back to `core` Streams]

== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf2/Stream.h>
class InputStream;
----

An input stream can be used to load resources from various data sources. Generally, resource classes have a constructor that takes an `InputStream`.

The classes that inherits `InputStream` are:

- xref:BufferInputStream.adoc[`BufferInputStream`]
- xref:CompressedInputStream.adoc[`CompressedInputStream`]
- xref:FileInputStream.adoc[`FileInputStream`]
- xref:MemoryInputStream.adoc[`MemoryInputStream`]

See also: xref:OutputStream.adoc[`OutputStream`]

== Member Functions

[#_constructors]
=== `InputStream` contructors

[source]
----
InputStream() = default; <1>
InputStream(const InputStream&) = delete; <2>
InputStream(InputStream&&) noexcept = default; <3>
----

<1> Default constructor.
<2> Deleted copy constructor.
<3> Defaulted move constructor.

=== `InputStream` destructor

[source]
----
virtual ~InputStream();
----

Destructor is virtual so that you can use pointers to `InputStream` safely.

=== `operator=`

[source]
----
InputStream& operator=(const InputStream&) = delete; <1>
InputStream& operator=(InputStream&&) noexcept = default; <2>
----

<1> Deleted copy assignment.
<2> Defaulted move assignment.

=== `finished`

[source]
----
virtual bool finished() = 0;
----

Tell if the stream is at the end.

=== `read`

[source]
----
virtual std::size_t read(Span<uint8_t> buffer) = 0; <1>
std::size_t read(uint8_t& byte); <2>
----

<1> Read data from the stream to a buffer
<2> Read a single byte from the stream

Return the number of bytes actually read.

=== `seek`

[source]
----
virtual void seek(std::ptrdiff_t position) = 0;
----

Change the current reading position, from the beginning.

=== `skip`

[source]
----
virtual void skip(std::ptrdiff_t position) = 0;
----

Change the current reading position, from the current position.
