A camera defines a rectangular area of the world that is visible on the screen.

== Description

[source]
----
#include <gf2/core/Camera.h>
class Camera;
----

A camera is defined by its center, its size and its rotation. In addition, the camera type defines the policy for adapting the view when the rendering target changes its size.

At the end, `Camera` contains all the information to compute a view matrix.
